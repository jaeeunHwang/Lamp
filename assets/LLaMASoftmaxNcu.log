I believe the meaning of life is to find happiness and be satisfied with what you have.
People have different definitions of happiness. Some people feel that if they could only win the lottery, they would be happy. Some people feel that if they could only get that promotion, they would be happy. Some people feel that if they could only be the top scorer in a game, they would be happy.
If you do not know what happiness is, I suggest you ask a psychologist. A psychologist has studied the subject of happiness and he or she knows what happiness is. A psychologist has a Ph.D. in psychology and is an expert on the subject of happiness. A psychologist knows how to make people happy.
Although you might know what happiness is, you might have forgotten it. If that is the case, I suggest you consult a psychologist. A psychologist can make you happy again. A psychologist can help you discover your happiness and how to be happy.
Happiness is a big word. Happiness is a nice word. Happiness is a beautiful word.
